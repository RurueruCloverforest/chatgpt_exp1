# PixiJS Merge Game

This project showcases a small merge game built with PixiJS. Circles are created
in the center of the screen and move in random directions. When two circles of
the same level collide, they combine into a higher level circle. Hold the mouse
button and move around to use the mixing tool, which repels nearby circles.

## How to run

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. PixiJS is loaded from a CDN so no build step is required.
