# PixiJS Rectangle Demo

This repository contains a simple setup for rendering a rectangle using PixiJS. It includes basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to get started quickly.

This demo uses **PixiJS 8**, which requires initializing the application asynchronously before use.
The main script demonstrates this with `await app.init({ width, height, backgroundColor })`.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The page loads PixiJS from a CDN and displays a red square centered on a blue background.

No build step is required; just open the file directly or host it with any static file server.
